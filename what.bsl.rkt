;; synth

;; x : TrafficLight
;; (lambda (x) x) => does not satisfy check-expects

;; (lambda (x)
;;   (cond [(string=? x "red") ...]
;;         [(string=? x "yellow") ...]

;; => ... guess from checks...?

;; so I guess the next step is synthesizing the constant map
;; then we can refine from there
